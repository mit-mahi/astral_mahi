## Astral Trails Summer Project 2025 
Astral Trails aims at using a self made cloud chamber to analyse the cosmic rays falling upon our planet. This includes building the cloud chamber, capturing cosmic rays and then analysing the trails made by these rays using data science and standard research dataset.
